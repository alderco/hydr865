              <p>Let’s be honest, losing weight can be challenging and being
                overweight affects many parts of our lives both physically and
                emotionally. I have been the butt of fat jokes before and it
                does not feel good. I do not want anyone to feel how I felt.
              </p>
              <p>Recently, there have been advances in weight-loss assistance
                in the form of semaglutide and tirzepatide, many may know them
                by the brand names Ozempic and Manjaro.
              </p>
              <p>Originally, the medications were prescribed to individuals
                with Type-2 diabetes. The medical field noticed one of the
                side effects was controlled weight loss. In 2021, the FDA
                approved semaglutide to assist in weight-loss efforts and in
                May of 2022, tirzepatide was approved by the FDA to combat
                obesity and assist with an individual’s weight loss journey.
              </p>
              <h4>What is the difference in the two?</h4>
                <p>Healthline.com has a great explanation, “Semaglutide is
                  FDA approved to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand names
                  Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like
                  peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which means it mimics the
                  GLP-1 hormone and makes you feel less hungry. When you eat,
                  your digestive tract releases the GLP-1 hormone, prompting
                  the body to create more insulin. It can also send fullness
                  signals to the brain. Tirzepatide is sold under the brand
                  name Mounjaro. It’s both a glucose-dependent insulinotropic
                  polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Tirzepatide
                  mimics the GLP-1 hormone and the GIP hormone. The GIP hormone
                   can also trigger insulin creation and sensations of fullness.
                    This means tirzepatide may offer an extra weight loss boost.”
                </p>
                <h4>What is the cost?</h4>
                  <p>Semaglutide has a more economical price point than
                    tirzepatide and each price point is determined by how many
                    units your weekly shot is. Shots are sold in a package of
                    four (4) for a month’s supply.
                  </p>
